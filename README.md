##Project Features

###Alongside the functionality required for the project, we have also added the following features:
* User rings that serve as visual representation of CO2 saved and refresh every day
* The ability to view the rings of followed users (2 users- one ahead and one behind, based on current daily score) and see their CO2 savings distribution by category
* A streak system that rewards users with bonus points based on the number of consecutive days in which they fill the ring in order to encourage them to reduce CO2 production every day
* A quiz that allows users to provide personal information, if they wish to do so, which is used to provide more accurate data regarding their CO2 emissions
* Notification system that lets users know when someone follows them, when they complete an achievement or when their ranking changes relative to the users they are following
* A notification log that shows recent notifications and the time when they were received
* The ability users see their progress over a period of time through a personal graph
* Leaderboard with functionality for switching the time period (week, month, year) for both the user rankings and the personal graph
* The option for users to recover their password through email in case they forget it
* An event screen that enables users to create custom events, specifying a name, time, date and description, and to browse and join events of users that they are following
* Predictive search functionality that lets users see potential matches when searching for a profile to follow
* An user profile complete with statistics, the most recent achievements and recent activities that helped reduce CO2 emissions

## PDP's

### Julius
#### Developmental Goal
* Strong points
  * Good at programming, always useful when studying CSE
  * Good at organising stuff
* Weaker points
  * Teamwork in bigger groups, never had a big project like this
  * Accepting my own mistakes, somehow I'm never wrong?
* The points are not really related in a core quadrant way

#### Plan to reach my goal

##### G - Goal
* I want to learn how to lead a group through a programming assignment. 
  * This will be done when we are finished with the project
* I want to learn how to properly explain things related to this project,
  since I might someday do something with teaching others.

##### R - Reality (Your current situation)
* Right now im not too good at leading people, I can do it but it is done with great effort
* I'm plain bad at explaining things sometimes, but willing to learn a lot about it, mostly to help others and also to learn myself.

##### O - Options (Look at possible options)
* Maybe become the leader/chair of the group would be fun (already got this covered but why not add this here)
* I know a lot about programming already, so I can help everyone when they have questions. 

In both cases nothing is really stopping me from reaching my goals. 

##### W - Will (Motivation, plan of action)
* For the leading part I will constantly try to steer the group in the right direction, since it is also benifitial for the rest of the group. I will do this every meeting, and maybe inbetween via WhatsApp. The first step is be appointed chairman, and that already happened. My teammates can help me by telling me what to change if I do something wrong in their eyes. 
* For the explaining part I am going to try to help my teammates when they need it, mostly explaining things that arent immediately clear. I will do this when it is needed. And i cant really do that right now, first my teammates need to have questions. My teammates can help by asking me all the questions they want answered. I can't really make a concrete plan for this, since it depends on my teammates asking questions. 


### Paul
1. Strong points :
- good experience with programming (I studied in a Computer Science highschool with 7h of Programming/week)
- used to working in a group (I took part of plenty of charity organisations in which I had to handle and even coordinate projects)

   Weaker points :
- my experience in the Java language is not great (I only started coding in Java when university started, as I used to program in C++ before)
- I have never taken part in a big programming project and I will only now start to get familiar with the tools we will use and platforms

2. 

G: Biggest goal is to develop my programming skills. As I now believe that I want to follow a carreer in some Database field I hope that by working in this project I will find out if I really like this kind of job. I believe that at the ending of the project I will be able to have a pretty clear idea about it.

R: I only had the first real contact with Databases last quarter so it's pretty recent for me. I haven't done any extra work regarding this lately but I am planning on doing this.

O: I could try to be responsible for the Database part of our project but in the same time discuss all the matters with my teammates. I don't really think that there will be a problem regarding this, so I guess nothing is currently stopping me from reaching this goal.

W: First, I wanna do some research of how you have to include databases in the project, and then actually start trying to code and put all my ideas altogether. I am going to start this as soons as possible. The first concrete step is actually starting to test things on my own in order to gain some experience. My teammates will help me by deciding which options are better (code, style, performance).

### Pablo 

My two strong points are strategical vision and consistence. An example of consistence is the fact I was able to make a game in assembly without any prior knowledge in two weeks, by working hard and not stopying until achieving it. In a team I think both attributes are key, the first one helps when developing the concept and throughout the process to not loose track of the leng-endterms goals. The second one is seen when problems appear and you must keep working until finding a solution. 

My two weak points are my prior knowledge and too perfectionist.  One example of this is the time I lose in details in every project, nevertheless I like it. The first point refers to my lack of previous knowledge before starting the university related to programming which restricts me when starting big projects like this one. 

CORE QUADRANT



G- 
My goal within is this project is to expand my programming capablities and enlarge my tools when facing new problems in the future. As well, I would like to learn how to make the most of the process of working in a team towards the same aim, and learn organizational dificulties in order to prevent them from happining in future projects. 

Both aims are tightly related to the success of future projects and that is why they are important for me. 

I think this goals can never be fully achieved. However as more experience better abilities, therefore better performance. 

R- 

Yes, I truly think I’m doing my best in order to achieve bothe above mentioned goals. My programming knowledge is improving at its pace. Time, I would like to have more free time to focus on learning specific skills inside the programming field. 

O- 

The main path to achieve the mentioned goals is keep working and gaining experience along the project. I would like to learn and improve my skills when problems come to scene. I don’t think there is anything special that is not letting me achieve this goal.

W-

I am going to keep working hard towards my goal. From now on, I am already in the process of achieving the goal. I think strategy is key in fighting for goals, and right now I can do the strategy of the path towards my goals. My second goal is a collective goal, therefore to be achieved I need the collaboration of all the teammates. 

First of all I am going to deconstruct the aim, in small steps, identify the difficulties and try to work on them as hard as I can

### Vlad Florea (4791487)


Strong points:
* I enjoy working in a team and it gives me motivation to not waste any time.
* I am creatively focused and enjoy learning new things and brainstorming.

Weak points:
* I am prone to procrastinating and get anxiety from having deadlines closing in on me.
* I don’t have extensive experience with Java programming and I get overwhelmed by work at times.


G- Goal:
* Finishing the project as soon as possible while still delivering a complete and functional design.
* Discovering new facets of programming (JavaFX, using databases) and expanding upon my knowledge.
* Learning to work better as part of a team and becoming more focused overall.
* I wish to achieve all of these goals by the end of this project.

R- Reality:
* I’m eager to start work and slightly intimidated by the scale of the project.
* I’m optimistic about the capabilities of my team and hoping I don’t let anyone down.
* I feel like I still get sidetracked too easily when I should be doing work.

O- Options:
* Communicating with my team regularly and keeping track constantly of where I am with regards to achieving the goals I’ve set.
* Keeping a tight schedule and trying to not waste any time.
* I will use both of these options.
*Nothing is stopping me from reaching my goals aside from my own mental conditioning.

W- Will:
* I am going to start studying JavaFX and getting a better grasp on the knowledge I need. 
* I will do this now/ as soon as possible.
* The first step I can take is to start studying and discussing the details concerning the design of the application with my team.
* My teammates can help me by providing information about coding in the areas I’m not very familiar with and working at a steady pace alongside me.

### Jahson O'Dwyer Wha Binda (4772288)

Strong Points:
My will and determination to get “things done” no matter what obstacles are in the way. One such example being the completion of the Web project to create a Chess game coming from 0 programming experience.

In a team situation this allows for a constant move forward mentality to make sure we meet expectations.

Weak Points:
Probably following through with an idea I think is bad.
If needed to be done I will do it but can be hesitant

Plan to achieve goal:

Goal:
My learning goal in this exercise is to improve not only my programming knowledge and get experience working with a team but also to create a functional and feature-full piece of software.

I feel this is important because in it core this is the closest to working like a Computer Scientist as I have gotten to.

I will considered this goal achieved once we have created a piece of software that is functional and I can be proud of.

Reality:
I am in the processes in achieving my goal
So far everything seems to be going well and improvements seem to be to gain a greater understanding of the java programming language.

Options:
To achieve my goal I must learn online and from my teammates
I do not lean to a particular option I plan to rely on both.
My java programing skills right now are not up to par to make a full GUI.

Will:
To reach my goal I plan to work and learn hard as soon as possible
Right now I can start by learning JavaFX which we agreed would be to used to make the GUI.
Yes we have teammates with more knowledge and experience so learning from them would be great.


### Kamron Geijsen  
Student number: 4892836  
Date of birth: 28/6/2000  


#### Strenghts and weaknesses

##### Strong points:
* Java: ~6 years with many (group) projects
* Gamemakers critique/reviewer hobbyist (may help with the design in the front-end)

##### Weaker points:
* Database
* Legibility (Testing and comments)
* Punctuality (Arriving on time)

#### Core quadrants  
Quality: Self-taught Java programmer  
Pitfall: Code tends to be lazy and illegable

Quality: Open for many interpretations  
Pitfall: Indecisive

Quality: Eye for detail  
Pitfall: Slow worker


#### Plan to reach my goal

##### Goal:
* My goal is to learn more about the pro's and con's of working in a large group and to share project-philosophies and idea's with my teammates, both ways.
* I believe that gaining experience though this project will be beneficial for my potential future projects and hopefully as well for my teammates.
* I would naturally also like to improve my expertise in the fields that I have marked as 'Weaker points' but I would rather prioritise helping my teammates in need in the fields I am familiar with

##### Reality (Your current situation)
* Whenever I have free time, I pick up one of my many ongoing projects. So far these projects have helped me substantially with my project management, programming literacy and overall knowledge in computer science.
* Most of my projects are home-projects, so my programming style tends to be lazy and illegable for others.

##### Options (Look at possible options) & Will
* Just by finishing the project (regardless of it's quality) and trying different work methods, will help to advance towards my final goal.
* Communication with my teammates will be key to reach my goal, as I might learn through both experience and dialogue what kind of project management does and doesn't work.
