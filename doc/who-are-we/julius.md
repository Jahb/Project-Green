# My PDP

## Developmental Goal
* Strong points
  * Good at programming, always useful when studying CSE
  * Good at organising stuff
* Weaker points
  * Teamwork in bigger groups, never had a big project like this
  * Accepting my own mistakes, somehow I'm never wrong?
* The points are not really related in a core quadrant way

## Plan to reach my goal

### G - Goal
* I want to learn how to lead a group through a programming assignment. 
  * This will be done when we are finished with the project
* I want to learn how to properly explain things related to this project,
  since I might someday do something with teaching others.

### R - Reality (Your current situation)
* Right now im not too good at leading people, I can do it but it is done with great effort
* I'm plain bad at explaining things sometimes, but willing to learn a lot about it, mostly to help others and also to learn myself.

### O - Options (Look at possible options)
* Maybe become the leader/chair of the group would be fun (already got this covered but why not add this here)
* I know a lot about programming already, so I can help everyone when they have questions. 

In both cases nothing is really stopping me from reaching my goals. 

###W - Will (Motivation, plan of action)
* For the leading part I will constantly try to steer the group in the right direction, since it is also benifitial for the rest of the group. I will do this every meeting, and maybe inbetween via WhatsApp. The first step is be appointed chairman, and that already happened. My teammates can help me by telling me what to change if I do something wrong in their eyes. 
* For the explaining part I am going to try to help my teammates when they need it, mostly explaining things that arent immediately clear. I will do this when it is needed. And i cant really do that right now, first my teammates need to have questions. My teammates can help by asking me all the questions they want answered. I can't really make a concrete plan for this, since it depends on my teammates asking questions.
