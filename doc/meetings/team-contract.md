# Team Contract
> _pollution by the green pollution project_

## Team members
* Julius de Jeu
* Vlad Florea
* Kamron Geijsen
* Jahson O'Dwyer Wha Binda
* Pablo Rodrigo Valero
* Paul Stepanov

### Day, time, and place for regular team meetings
Every monday, during the lecture and at least one more per week, on wednesday or friday

### Preferred method of communication (e.g., e-mail, cell phone, wired phone, Blackboard Discussion Board, face-to-face, in a certain class) in order to inform each other of team meetings, announcement, updates, reminders, problems:
* WhatsApp group for general communication
* Mattermost for questions to the TA/guy that buys our product

### Decision-making policy (by consensus? by majority vote?):
A vote, and if the the vote is 50/50: we the person that wants to program the feature will be allowed one extra vote and he will program it mostly himself.

### Method for setting and following meeting agendas (Who will set each agenda? When? How will team members be notified/reminded? Who will be responsible for the team following the agenda during a team meeting?):
Im gonna guess the chair does that, it'll be made at least 1 day beforehand. A message in the WhatsApp group will be used as a notification. The responsible person will be the scrum master together with the chair.

### On dropout
We shittalk the person for exactly 10 minutes, and after that we will redivide the work.

### What if you dislike your part
Depends on how you got it, as a last pick we can discuss it, but otherwise you picked it yourself so you should finish it.
