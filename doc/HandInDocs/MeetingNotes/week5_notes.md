# Meeting 4 Week 5
**Chairman:** Jahson O'Dwyer Wha Binda

**Secretary:** Julius De Jeu

**Note by the TA: We can start whenever we want and just recap it with him.**

## Opening
> Check if everyone is present

## Approval of the agenda
> Make sure everything that needs to be discussed is in the agenda or add it if something is missing.


## Points of action
- Create Reflexion about last week sprints
    - done
- Talk about current progress of the project
    - The client guys showed their new UI, its very fancy and has a nice flat design.
- GUI team demonstrate what they have worked on.
    - All of the previous requirements for the GUI seem to have been made, but the smaller circles used to pick what kind of good thing you did need to be a bit bigger, since they are too small. The buttons need to be bigger, maybe multiple layered menu's? Leaderboard looks nice
    - Friends list is just going to be all the users available, since that is easier. Maybe add something alike to a follow list instead of friends.
    - Communication is important, Kamron made icons that Vlad did not know about.
    - Julius is asking for way too much: different folders for the different kinds as resources.
    - The client team is _deleting_ images...
    - Kamron: "Make the width wider and the lenght longer"
- Discuss Test Coverage and how to fix checkstyle.
    - DB guys have 100-ish%
